Create race feed for homepage of user's follower's posts

how microposts feed works:
- feed defined in user.rb, specifically microposts, and from_users_followed_by defined in microposts.rb
- feed is fed into static_pages_controller where it's defined as @feed_items
- @feed_items is then rendered in shared/feed, iterates through  it and places it based on shared/feed_item, then paginated

races feed:
- need to create race feed function in user model
	- Race.from_users_followed_by(self) -- must copy functionality from the microposts.rb model
- feed this into a @race_items symbol in static_pages_controller
- render @race_items similarly to _feed
	- race partial already defined (from user's feed)
- want a race feed to include the last 5 races in a user's friends, from the last 3 months

race model:
- add splits array to races model, use similar hash structure as the race time
- add elevation change?
- EVENT TYPE - run/bike/swim

user model: 
- goal times for race types, specific races
