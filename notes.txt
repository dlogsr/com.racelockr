Notes

-8/18/14-
how microposts feed works:
- feed defined in user.rb, specifically microposts, and from_users_followed_by defined in microposts.rb
- feed is fed into static_pages_controller where it's defined as @feed_items
- @feed_items is then rendered in shared/feed, iterates through  it and places it based on shared/feed_item, then paginated


-8/26/14-
how followers works:
- routes defined as followers, following
- user controller defines these two, sets the @users variable and sends it to show_follow view
- member?
